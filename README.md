## Project Overview

Travel Book is a modern web application designed to help users document, organize, and share their travel experiences. It serves as a digital travel journal where users can record memories, photos, and details about places they've visited. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for travelers to create a personal collection of travel stories, organize them by location and date, and optionally share them with others.

## Purpose & Vision

The primary purpose of Travel Book is to give travelers a dedicated space to preserve their travel memories in a structured and visually appealing way. Rather than having travel photos scattered across different devices or social media platforms, Travel Book centralizes these experiences into a cohesive travel journal that can be accessed from anywhere.

Key goals of the platform include:
- Providing an intuitive way to document travel experiences
- Creating a searchable repository of personal travel memories
- Offering data visualization of travel patterns and statistics
- Supporting offline access for users on the go
